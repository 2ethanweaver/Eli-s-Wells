        <h1>Our Stories</h1>

        <p>
From 2017–2019, my son, Eli Stein, served as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Ghana Accra West Mission. While serving in Oda, he once called me during a break to get a drink of water. When I asked where the water came from, he explained that government water trucks filled the polytank at their apartment. He had sent photos of him and his companion cleaning that tank, and when I asked why, he told me it collected hair, dirt, mud, feces, and even a dead mouse.
I asked, “…and this is the water you’re drinking?”
He said, “Dad, don’t worry. It’s been triple filtered.”
But the water in his glass was still brown. I told him, “You know there’s clean water in an aquifer right under your feet.”
In 2023, I was talking with my friend Doug Alley, who frequently travels to Ghana delivering packages to missionaries. When I mentioned Eli’s experience, we began discussing the need for wells. After one of his trips, Doug returned and asked me, “Do you believe in miracles?”
“I do,” I told him.
He said that on his flight home, he had been seated next to a man from New Jersey who digs wells in Ghana.
The following week, the three of us held a conference call and scheduled three wells—one in Buduburam and two in Sunyani. That moment became the beginning of Eli’s Wells.
Since then, through the generosity of our donors, we have completed nineteen wells, including our most recent one for a Muslim community and school in Sunyani. What began with a troubling glass of water has grown into a mission to bring clean, reliable water to communities across Ghana—one miracle at a time.
